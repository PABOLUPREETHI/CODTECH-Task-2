**Objective**

The objective of this `VulnerabilityScanner` Java program is to:

1. Scan a specified hostname for open common ports.
2. Detect and identify services running on these ports using banner grabbing.
3. Check for known vulnerabilities based on the detected service versions.
   
**Key Activities**

1. **Port Scanning**: Attempt to connect to a list of common ports on the specified hostname to determine if they are open.
2. **Service Detection**: Retrieve and analyze banners from open ports to identify the running services and their versions.
3. **Vulnerability Checking**: Compare the detected service versions against known vulnerabilities and report any potential issues.

**Technologies Used**

 **Java Programming Language**: The core language used for developing the application.
 
 **Java Networking (java.net.Socket)**: For creating socket connections to scan ports and retrieve service banners.
 
 **I/O Streams (java.io.InputStream)**: For reading data from network connections to detect service banners.
